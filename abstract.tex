Control Systems are widely used in the industrial sector and seek greater efficiency of time and energy, maintaining a quality of processes and system controlled.
%
The objective of this study is to show an unconventional implementation of a closed loop control using the Paraconsistent Annotated Logic of annotation with two values (PAL2v) in order to meet specific performance requirements in a proposed physical system.
%
The development of techniques classified as Artificial Intelligence has given rise to other options for the control of systems, however there is still a shortage of implementations and tests using alternative techniques.
%
The studies and the initial results show a great potential for the implementation and exploration of LPA2v in control systems, similar to the most widespread techniques such as Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, Adaptive Control or Evolutionary Algorithm.
